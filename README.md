# Kahuna
## Description
Kahuna is an iOS weather application specifically designed for novice surfers. It offers real-time surfing condition data for various locations across the Netherlands, aiding users in identifying the optimal spots for surfing at any given moment. Its primary aim is to simplify the understanding of surfability at each location.

## Instructions
To get started, download the project and integrate it with your Swift environment. Ensure that the dependencies align before running it on an emulator or a device.

## Demo
A demo version of the application's features and interface is under development and will be shared soon.

## Roadmap
Our future plan includes extending Kahuna's capabilities beyond the Netherlands, aiming to include prime surfing spots from around the world. Furthermore, we intend to enhance the user experience by integrating social features, allowing surfers to connect and share their experiences.

## Project Status
Kahuna was initiated as a specialized project, and its future progression will depend on user interest and feedback. While its current development is geared towards catering to beginner surfers, we're open to expanding its functionality to cater to more experienced surfers based on demand and response.
